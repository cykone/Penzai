        <h1>Supporting people to find roles that really fit them</h1>
        <p class="intro-text">PENZAI is in an early stage of changing the way of how people find new challenges. We
          believe that work must be about us as individuals and especially about our personal goals and aspirations. And
          while most organizations and job platforms still try to find and match people based on their past, we thought:
          "Isn't it much more natural to ask where do you want to go, instead of where have you been?".

        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>Empower people to change</p>
        <h3>What we do</h3>
        <p>PENZAI changes how organizations find talent. Instead of focusing on people’s experiences, PENZAI understands
          peoples’ aspirations and personal development. It leverages this knowledge to connect the right candidates
          with businesses that will support their aspirations.</p>
        <h3>Why</h3>
        <p>PENZAI believes that companies have to understand themselves as a service provider for their workforce; this
          includes the support to meet the learning aspirations of their employees. But today, many organizations still
          understand learning and developing new competencies as a cost factor and will only be supported as long as it
          is relevant to the current job description. PENZAI wants to help people to find their passion,
          make a career change easy, and match them with organizations that support their aspirations.</p>
