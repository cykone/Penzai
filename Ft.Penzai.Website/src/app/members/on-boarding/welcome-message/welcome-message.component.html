        <p> Penzai is an AI-Driven Platform which brings intelligence from mining millions of data points and billions of interactions
          across the internet to you. It helps to understand you and to match the best possible career development information
          with you. Our business model is not based on selling or using your data in a way you donâ€˜t realise it. We will
          always ask you for permission if we see the need to share your information with any 3rd party. This is for instance
          the case if you sign up for courses or classes with partner organisations. The protection of your data and privacy
          is our second mission after supporting you over your career journey. Therefor we created the career vault to give
          you full control of who is accessing and using your data on our platform.</p>
